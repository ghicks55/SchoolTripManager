I'll create a comprehensive prompt for an AI coding agent to develop a business application for a travel agency that manages school group trips.

# AI Coding Agent Prompt: School Group Trip Management Application

## Project Overview
Develop a web application for a travel agency to efficiently manage school group trips. The application will track comprehensive trip data, participant information, logistics, and financial details as specified in the requirements document.

## Core Requirements

### Authentication & Access
- Implement Google Authentication for secure login
- Create role-based access controls (Admin, Trip Director, Travel Agent, Chaperone)
- Enable data sharing with controlled permissions for different stakeholders

### Data Models
Based on the provided document, implement the following data structures:

1. **Groups**
   - School name, group name, location, travel dates
   - Registration details, GMR number, director information
   - Transportation details (bus supplier, number of buses, charter number)
   - Contract status, insurance status, payment tracking

2. **Group Itineraries**
   - Calendar view of all trips
   - Day-by-day activity tracking
   - Visual timeline representation

3. **Bus Suppliers**
   - Company details and contact information
   - Contract storage and management
   - Bus allocation and tracking

4. **Lunch Management**
   - Meal type counts and requirements
   - Scheduling (date/time)
   - Special dietary needs

5. **Participant Roster**
   - Comprehensive traveler information
   - Categorization (student, chaperone, director)
   - Preferences (magic band color, t-shirt size, meal options)
   - Insurance selection and room assignments

6. **Waiting List**
   - Potential traveler information
   - Automated promotion when spots become available

7. **Drop-offs Tracking**
   - Record of participants who cancel
   - Reason for cancellation (optional)
   - Impact on rooming and grouping

8. **Rooming Management**
   - Room assignment and categorization
   - Occupancy tracking
   - Gender-based grouping

9. **Chaperone Groups**
   - Assignment of students to chaperones
   - Room number cross-referencing

10. **Disney Experience Integration**
    - Credential management
    - Avatar selection
    - Link status tracking

### Technical Requirements
- Develop as a responsive web application with mobile compatibility
- Implement a modern tech stack (recommend: React/Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB/Firebase)
- Use RESTful API architecture
- Deploy on cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Implement secure data handling practices (encryption, access controls)
- Create comprehensive backup and recovery systems

### User Experience Features
- Interactive dashboard with key metrics and upcoming trips
- Searchable and filterable data tables
- Export functionality (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- Automated email notifications for key events (registration opening, payment deadlines)
- Document upload and storage (contracts, release forms)

### Reporting Capabilities
- Financial summaries and projections
- Participant demographics
- Trip statistics and comparisons
- Custom report builder

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Begin with data model design and database schema
2. Implement authentication and basic CRUD operations
3. Develop core screens for each major function
4. Add reporting and dashboard features
5. Implement export and integration capabilities
6. Build notification system
7. Complete UI polishing and responsive design

## Deliverables
- Fully functional web application with described features
- Administrator documentation
- User guides for different permission levels
- API documentation for potential future integrations
- Deployment scripts and configuration files
- Database backup and restoration procedures

## Priorities
1. Data security and privacy compliance
2. Intuitive user experience requiring minimal training
3. Comprehensive data tracking with minimal manual entry
4. Reliability and performance under concurrent use
5. Extensibility for future feature additions

The application should streamline the complex process of managing group travel while ensuring all stakeholders have appropriate access to the information they need, ultimately providing a better experience for the travel agency, schools, and trip participants.
